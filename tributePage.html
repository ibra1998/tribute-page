¿Who is Oscar Pierre?
</h2>
<p>
Oscar Piere is a software developer, and one of the founders of one of the most important start-ups in Spain: Glovo. Glovo is an app that helps to coordinate restaurants, customers and riders. Riders are "independent" workers that delivers the food from restaurants to people's home. They are paid a fee for each delivery they made. They are usually given tips from customers, and sometime even from restaurants.<br/>
Even if there are similar apps to Glovo, glovo is different by having a very good software, a schedule where workers can choose the hours they want to work on and they deliver more than things than only food.

What do I admire from him
</h2>
<p>He studied in the same university than me,and he studied aeronautics engineering, which is tough career. I like the fact that he is from somewhere near, but the thing I admire the most, is the fact that thanks to his initiative, there has been created thousands of jobs.</p>
<h2 class="questions">
My point of view about the riders problem
</h2>
<p>
One of the problems they say this app has created is a about the bad quality of the jobs created. Riders are self employeed and don't have a minimum salary, they don't have the rights the spanish law gives them. There is also a problem about foreign people in an illegal situation using the app to deliver in other's people's name, which is a fraud.
<br/>
I have worked for glovo and uber eats (another app using the same busness model as glovo) and I don't agree at all about this accusations in some points. Glovo is meant to be used as temporary job, studentjob or for people that likes doing exercice while working. So, Glovo is not responsible of that there are some people that need to work more hours. There are people that connects 60 hours a week in order to reach a salary of 2000€, or when there is an illegal share, they work even for less. A normal person in good hours couldreach salaries from 8 to 20 euros the hour. It's not glovo's fault that there are peoplo needing to work more or that are in an illegal situation.
<br/>
I think that is the government's fault, that people need to work for Glovo, because, who made the laws that makes it difficult for non-EU citizens to work in Spain? Another problem I had in this job were taxes: I had to pay for than half of what I earned for taxes. In this aspect,Glovo pays better that the other platforms and offers better and cheaper materials.
